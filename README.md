# ALXS Slidestack

ALXS Slidestack is a slideshow-style content container system, that works for all content instead of just images. These are some of the content types you can have, but ultimately it's up to your own imagination what content you use this for.

  - Audio (Soundcloud/Mixcloud)
  - Video (Youtube)
  - Images
  - Standard HTML

I've tried to keep the Slidestack code as minimal but self explanetory as I can, whilst putting in as many features as possible but not go over the top with options.  

> The ultimate goal for Slidestack is to help developers quickly and easily get 
> a working prototype of sliding content ready as quickly as possible,
> giving as many parameters as I think they would need to create a
> beautiful website. The sample code is in plain HTML/CSS/jQuery and utilises the jQuery UI suite, however you do not need to include jQuery UI should you not need it.

### Version
1.0.0


### Installation

Simply download the zip file and exchange the content in the "slide-container" class divs in the index.html file, for the simplest, quickest installation. 

After you have done this, take a look in the slidestack.settings.js file in the root folder, to get an idea for the settings and parameters available (they're all commented).

### Options

I'm going to document all of the available options here soon, along with the parameters that each options accepts.Some of the useful ones are:

* direction (scroll transition direction - horizontal/vertical)
* linklayout (updown/sides/horizontal/vertical)
* linkposition (top/bottom/left/right)
* speed
* easein
* easeout


### Development

Want to contribute? Great!

Please feel free to clone the repo and submit any pull requests, I'll get them incorporated as quickly as possible.
